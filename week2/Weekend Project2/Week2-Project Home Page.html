        <h3>Car</h3>
        <p>
            A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. 
            Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, 
            have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.
            Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. 
            The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor 
            Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became widely available in the 
            early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, 
            an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, 
            where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in
            Western Europe and other parts of the world.Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger
            comfort, and a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and controls have been
            added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex. These include rear reversing cameras, 
            air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are
            propelled by an internal combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels.
