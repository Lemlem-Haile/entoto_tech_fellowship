<div class= "etymology">       
<h3>Etymology</h3>
    
<p>The word car is believed to originate 
from the Latin word carrus or carrum ("wheeled vehicle"), 
or the Middle English word carre (meaning "two-wheel cart", 
from Old North French). In turn, these originated from the 
Gaulish word karros (a Gallic chariot). It originally referred
to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.
"Motor car" is attested from 1895, and is the usual formal name for cars 
in British English. "Autocar" is a variant that is also attested from 1895,
but that is now considered archaic. It literally means 
"self-propelled car". The term "horseless carriage" 
was used by some to refer to the first cars at the time 
that they were being built, and is attested from 1895.

<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p> 
    Cars are equipped with controls used for driving, 
    passenger comfort and safety, normally operated by a 
    combination of the use of feet and hands, and occasionally 
    by voice on 21st century cars. These controls include a steering 
    wheel, pedals for operating the brakes and controlling the car's speed
    (and, in a manual transmission car, a clutch pedal), a shift lever or
    stick for changing gears, and a number of buttons and dials for turning 
    on lights, ventilation and other functions. Modern cars' controls 
    are now standardised, such as the location for the accelerator and brake,
    but this was not always the case. Controls are evolving in response to new technologies,
    for example the electric car and the integration of mobile communications.

<h3>Cost and Benefits</h3>

<p > 
    The costs of car usage, which may include the cost of: 
    acquiring the vehicle, repairs and auto maintenance, fuel,
    depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance,
    are weighed against the cost of the alternatives, and the value of
    the benefits – perceived and real – of vehicle usage. The benefits 
    may include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence and convenience.
    During the 1920s, cars had another benefit: "couples finally had a way to head 
    off on unchaperoned dates, plus they had a private space to snuggle up close at the end 
    of the night."Similarly the costs to society of car use may include; maintaining roads,
    land use, air pollution, road congestion, public health, health care, and of disposing 
    of the vehicle at the end of its life; and can be balanced against the value of the benefits
    to society that car use generates.
